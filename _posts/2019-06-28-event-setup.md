---
When it comes to events, there are a lot of things you need to do that usually come together and you lose track of one or more thing. So I decided to keep a list of my event to-dos. Here it is:

1. Ask bio and pictures to the speaker
2. define title and setup the landing page and post
3. set up email automation
4. create the event page on eventbrite (be sure to check dates)
5. disable eventbrite autoreminder
6. send invitation to VIP and citizen (be sure to insert date, time and location in the email)
7. pulish on social network
8. send invitation to others in out list
9. schedule reminder
