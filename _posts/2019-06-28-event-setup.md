When it comes to events, there are a lot of things you need to do that usually come together and you lose track of one or more thing. So I decided to keep a list of my event to-dos. Here it is:

0. Define event date and block it on Marco's calendar
1. Ask bio, pictures, talk title, abstract and presentation to the speaker
2. define title and setup the landing page and related post
3. set up email automation (request received, invitation, reminder 1, reminder 2)
4. create the event page on eventbrite (be sure to check dates)
5. change event type and language under "order options" to registration and US lang.
5. remove automated reminder from eventbrite
6. book the metting room
7. send invitation to citizen and list, but before to do that send the same email to yourself and check date, day of the week, and especially links.
8. create a calendar reminder for founders
9. send invitation to citizen (be sure to insert date, time and location in the email)
10. publish on social network
11. send invitation to others in our list
12. schedule reminders
13. schedule citizen reminder for starting time
14. send pictures to the event album
